# Introduction

C is a general purpose programming language, is the languege used to build the
unix operating system in the 60's

Is the language used to build the fundamental programs in the industry just like
Git, Linux kernel, Windows and Apple operating systems, etc. Compiles directly
to machine code, it has been called a "system programming language" because it
is useful for writing compilers and "low level" programs.

C provides the fundamental control-flow constructions required for
well-structured programs: state grouping, decision making (if-else), selecting
one of a set of possible cases (switch), looping with the termination test at
the top (while, for) or at the bottom (do), and early loop exit (break).
